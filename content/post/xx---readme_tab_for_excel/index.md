# BACKGROUND STORY

While data analytic work now have plenty of platform and tools, many business are still using Excel as their main program/software/app. 

Some of my works used Excel for a simple dashboard or even a work report. 
Sometimes I saw some Excel dashboard that is quite complicated and I have seen my colleagues were confused on how to use it. 

In other cases, we received different datasets in Excel files. They could be a new data or just a transformed version of the larger data. 
But sometimes, we received the files almost every day due to the nature of the project.
This has caused some confusions on what the data is about, or worse, the version of the revision (when the filename itself does not tell  you about it).

# SOLUTION

We tried to duplicate how a good data science project will have a README file. 
But for Excel, we can always have one tab for this readme, while the other tab is the content of the file.
