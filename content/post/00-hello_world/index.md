# BACKGROUND STORY

Creating a portfolio website has been a personal project todolist for so many years. 
But, there were a lot of obstacles (mostly personal motivations) to clearly make one.

- As many typical website builders (Wix, Squarespace, etc.) will require cost to host, which one is worth it to try for my very early stage build? Most of these are for eCommerce, and I don't need many of these tools.
- Is there a pre-made theme among these websites that fit to my need?
- How to organize the website for what I can present/provide? I am not in Art & Design field where I have many pictures or showcase products.

Sometime ago, I found portfolio website from someone in tech. The theme was not what I have seen in common website builders.

At that time, I have not coded with Python, Linux, or anything. I was not even familiar with Github etc. 
I just want to use that theme. 

So, I tried to follow any articles I could find. 
But I could not finish testing and got a job that was not that technical anyway.
