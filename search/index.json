[{"content":"BACKGROUND STORY Creating a portfolio website has been a personal project todolist for so many years. But, there were a lot of obstacles (mostly personal motivations) to clearly make one.\nThe more legit reasons are:\nAs many typical website builders (Wix, Squarespace, etc.) will require cost to host, which one is worth it to try for my very early stage build? Most of these are for eCommerce, and I don\u0026rsquo;t need many of these tools. Is there a pre-made theme among these websites that fit to my need? How to organize the website for what I can present/provide? I am not in Art \u0026amp; Design field where I have many pictures or showcase products. A MORE ADVANCED PATH (why run before walk) Sometime ago, I found portfolio website from someone in tech. The theme was not what I have seen in common website builders. At the footer of the page, it says \u0026lsquo;Built with Hugo, through Netlify\u0026quot;. At that time, I have not coded with Python, Linux, or anything. I was not even familiar with Github etc. I just want to use that theme.\nSo, I tried to follow any articles I could find. But I could not finish testing and got a job that was not that technical anyway. So I thought, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need it anyway; so I stopped.\nNOW Fast forward, I found out that Github can host a simple static website through the pages. So, I guess it is time to finally check that todolist\u0026hellip; except,\u0026hellip;\nMORE HEADACHE {::comment}comment {:/comment}\n","date":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://raffwh.github.io/p/hello-world/cover_hu_9e6bcf9cfe9a9448.jpg","permalink":"https://raffwh.github.io/p/hello-world/","title":"Hello World of Website Building"},{"content":"THE STORY When I was working at UMass Medical School, the Ophthalmology Department was looking to update the department logo. Somehow I was having design fever again and wanted to dust off my design skill. I have been involved in my lab\u0026rsquo;s website and knew many people in the department, so why not.\nDESIGN IDEA / THINKING ICON / BASE DESIGN Our lab (and many other research-side teams) has several genetic projects. I was looking into how to merge / mix / assimilate something that is perceived as genetic with something that is like an eye.\nGENETIC Few ideas I had about some visuals that are common in genetic studies are:\nBlots (like western blot, Southern blot, northwestern blot, etc.) Marking of mutations in a chromosome Exon splices EYE I guess there is not much variety or there is no need for an out-of-the-box idea for an eye\nA full eye, anterior view Sagittal view of eyeball The iris COLOR I had known about Pantone way before, but Pantone color of the year somehow became a big news recently and it felt the color had become a trendy influencers topic. The color of the 2021 was somehow a two-colors instead of one. There some info on the meaning of each color, and I thought they could fit to the department vision or current situation. So I decided to just use these 2 colors.\nCREATION I came up with three different styles.\nCOMMON AMONG 3 I couldn\u0026rsquo;t come up with three totally different ideas; so, these 3 have very similar workflows:\nI used Adobe Illustrator circular pattern\nFirst, I created a custom brush, based on some pattern of genetic icons I came up earlier. Then, I created a circle line vector. Finally, I applied the line using custom brush instead of a solid line. The 2021 text is the same on all three\nThe 20 uses the gray color to mark both the unchanging part of the year (the two thousand), as well as that we just passed the year 2020, and the 2020 being marked gray can mean as the off. The 21 uses the yellow (Illuminating) to mark the new year, and maybe the new meaning (we were just starting to get used to COVID19 life anyway). ART 1 The eye part is based on the iris, while the line is more like line-chart but I can say it is like exon splices too. There is a flare on the inner lower left, just mimicking how eye icon has flare to show the transparency.\nART 2 The eye base is technically a full front eye. The original logo of UMass Eye Center used this style of eye as well (and many other eye clinics). The line part was inspired a bit from the Southern blot, but technically it was created using R as a stacked bar graph.\nART 3 The idea is similar to Art 1, but there is more flair added. The line part was like chromosome even though it was created with random ellipse tools.\nSELECTION In the end I selected Art 2 since I like the stacked bar graph line. Art 1 is good too, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really show like an eye. Art 3 is just too busy.\nIN THE END The deparment had a form to submit the designs. I even created a report form to explain my thinking: But the decision makers in the end decided not to change their old logo at all 😓.\n","date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://raffwh.github.io/p/eye-center-logo-2021/art_2_hu_702dee104394fc83.jpg","permalink":"https://raffwh.github.io/p/eye-center-logo-2021/","title":"Eye Center Logo 2021"},{"content":"BACKGROUND STORY While data analytic work now have plenty of platform and tools, many business are still using Excel as their main program/software/app.\nSome of my works used Excel for a simple dashboard or even a work report. Sometimes I saw some Excel dashboard that is quite complicated and I have seen my colleagues were confused on how to use it.\nIn other cases, we received different datasets in Excel files. They could be a new data or just a transformed version of the larger data. But sometimes, we received the files almost every day due to the nature of the project. This has caused some confusions on what the data is about, or worse, the version of the revision (when the filename itself does not tell you about it).\nSOLUTION We tried to duplicate how a good data science project will have a README file. But for Excel, we can always have one tab for this readme, while the other tab is the content of the file.\n","date":"2020-08-22T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://raffwh.github.io/p/readme-excel/","title":"Readme for Excel file"}]
