&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was working at UMass Medical School, the Ophthalmology Department was looking to update the department logo.
Somehow I was having design fever again and wanted to dust off my design skill.
I have been involved in my lab&amp;rsquo;s website and knew many people in the department, so why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="design-idea--thinking"&gt;DESIGN IDEA / THINKING
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id="icon--base-design"&gt;ICON / BASE DESIGN
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our lab (and many other research-side teams) has several genetic projects.
I was looking into how to merge / mix / assimilate something that is perceived as genetic with something that is like an eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="genetic"&gt;GENETIC
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few ideas I had about some visuals that are common in genetic studies are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blots (like western blot, Southern blot, northwestern blot, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marking of mutations in a chromosome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exon splices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eye"&gt;EYE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess there is not much variety or there is no need for an out-of-the-box idea for an eye&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A full eye, anterior view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sagittal view of eyeball&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The iris&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="color"&gt;COLOR
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had known about Pantone way before, but Pantone color of the year somehow became a big news recently and it felt the color had become a trendy influencers topic.
The color of the 2021 was somehow a two-colors instead of one.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There some info on the meaning of each color, and I thought they could fit to the department vision or current situation.
So I decided to just use these 2 colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="creation"&gt;CREATION
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came up with three different styles.&lt;/p&gt;

data-flex-grow="100"
data-flex-basis="240px"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="common-among-3"&gt;COMMON AMONG 3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t come up with three totally different ideas; so, these 3 have very similar workflows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Adobe Illustrator circular pattern&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I created a custom brush, based on some pattern of genetic icons I came up earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, I created a circle line vector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I applied the line using custom brush instead of a solid line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2021 text is the same on all three&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; uses the gray color to mark both the unchanging part of the year (the two thousand), as well as that we just passed the year 2020, and the 20&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; being marked gray can mean as the &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt; uses the yellow (Illuminating) to mark the new year, and maybe the new meaning (we were just starting to get used to COVID19 life anyway).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="art-1"&gt;ART 1
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eye part is based on the iris, while the line is more like line-chart but I can say it is like exon splices too.
There is a flare on the inner lower left, just mimicking how eye icon has flare to show the transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="art-2"&gt;ART 2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eye base is technically a full front eye.
The original logo of UMass Eye Center used this style of eye as well (and many other eye clinics).
The line part was inspired a bit from the Southern blot, but technically it was created using R as a stacked bar graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="art-3"&gt;ART 3
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is similar to Art 1, but there is more flair added.
The line part was like chromosome even though it was created with random ellipse tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="selection"&gt;SELECTION
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end I selected Art 2 since I like the stacked bar graph line. Art 1 is good too, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really show like an eye. Art 3 is just too busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="in-the-end"&gt;IN THE END
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deparment had a form to submit the designs.
I even created a report form to explain my thinking: &lt;img src="https://raffwh.github.io/p/eye-center-logo-2021/logo_report.jpg"

loading="lazy"
alt="report"
class="gallery-image"
data-flex-grow="73"
data-flex-basis="176px"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the decision makers in the end decided not to change their old logo at all 😓.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
